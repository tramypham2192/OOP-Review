In ONE Java file, only allow to have ONE public class. We can not write 2 public class in one Java file as follow:
public class A2 {
    public A2() {
        System.out.println("Hi!");
    }
}


public class B2 extends A2 {
    public B2() {
        System.out.println("Bye!");
    }
}

If we want to write class B2 in the same file with class A2, have to set default access modifier for class B2:
public class A2 {
    public A2() {
        System.out.println("Hi!");
    }
}


class B2 extends A2 {
    public B2() {
        System.out.println("Bye!");
    }
}
